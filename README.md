# Tetris

My remake of the classic arcade game Tetris. Written in Go and uses the 2D game engine `pixel`.
I took what I learnt from my snake remake project and improved on it here.

## How to run

To get the game running, download the assets from the following link and put them in a folder named `assets` in the
root directory of the tetris project:
https://hat-tap.itch.io/tetris-asset-pack

Then execute main:
```cmd
go run cmd/main/main.go
```
